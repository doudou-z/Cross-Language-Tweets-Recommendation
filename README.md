# Cross-Language-Tweets-Recommendation
Use latent semantic mapping and on-line machine learning algorithm to recommend tweets cross different languages

The ultimate goal is to recommend relevant tweets irrespective of languages (users can define languages), facilitating bi/multi-lingual people to gain more useful infomation while search in twitter.

Build the machine learning pipeline, including raw stream tweets crawling, preprocessing, feature extraction, stochastic gradient descent(SGD) implementation to learn the latent mapping, and evaluation.
